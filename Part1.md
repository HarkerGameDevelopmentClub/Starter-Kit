# Part 1. Creating the project and JavaFX manager class.

## Creating the project in Eclipse that works with JavaFX
You will need the Eclipse IDE which can be found at [eclipse.org](http://eclipse.org).
Once you have it downloaded and set up, create a new JavaFX project called "platformer".

You will need to inform Eclipse that you will be using JavaFX for this project.
By default, it will not allow you to access JavaFX API. (For more information, see the second answer [of this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33383248/eclipse-mars-wont-auto-import-javafx)

1. Go to Project â–¸ Properties and select Java Build Path in the sidebar of the Properties Window.
2. Go to the Libraries tab and click the disclosure triangle next to JRE System Library.
3. Double click "Access Rules" and then "Add" a new access rule with Resolution: Accessible and Rule Pattern: javafx/**

You should now be able to use JavaFX in the Eclipse project.

## Creating the Main class
The Main class that you will create in this part will do all of the interfacing with JavaFX necessary to create a window, run a frame loop, and respond to keyboard input. Once you create this class, you can use it as the foundation for any JavaFX game you make.

If you don't want to set up this class yourself, you can add [this starter file](Main.java) to your project and skip straight to part 2 of the tutorial series.
